**Work in progress**

A cutting-edge text adventure built using .NET with natural language processing and state-machine flow. Enigma of the Enchanted Forest invites players to explore a mysterious world filled with intrigue, puzzles, and unexpected twists.

## Features

- Written in C# for .NET platform
- Utilizes advanced state-machine logic for the game's narrative flow
- Natural language processing for better user experience

## Current state

The current state features a (not-so) warm welcome and immersive experience into the storytelling world of this project. The introduction presents an intriguing scenario and establishes the mysterious setting from the very start, without fixed, given choices for any scenario, and a natural-feeling, responsive text and visual rpompts that provide dynamic, real-time feedback for the player.

## How do I play?

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivankoros/forgotten-forest
```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or another C# IDE (I use Jetbrains' Rider)

3. Build and run the project

Enjoy the adventure, and stay tuned for updates as we expand the world and story!
